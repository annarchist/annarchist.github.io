<h1>Sydney's Newtown</h1>

<p>Newtown, a suburb of Sydney's inner west, is located approximately four kilometres southwest of the Sydney central business district, straddling the local government areas of the City of Sydney and Inner West Council in New South Wales, Australia.</p>

<p>King Street is the main street of Newtown and the centre of commercial and entertainment activity. The street follows the spine of a long ridge that rises up near the University of Sydney and extends to the south, becoming the Princes Highway at its southern end.</p>

<p>King Street is the central thoroughfare of the suburb of Newtown in Sydney, Australia. The area's residents, including a higher-than-average concentration of students, LGBT people, and artists, are most visible on this street, sealing Newtown's reputation as Sydney's premier hub of subcultures. The street can be divided geographically into two sections, North and South. King Street is particularly notable for the many picturesque Victorian-era and Edwardian-era commercial buildings that line the street.</p>

<p>King Street forms part of the Princes Highway officially and is allocated route A36.</p>

<p>Enmore Road branches off King Street towards the suburb of Enmore at Newtown Bridge, where the road passes over the railway line at Newtown Station. Enmore Road and King Street together comprise 9.1 kilometres of over 600 shopfronts. The main shopping strip of Newtown is the longest and most complete commercial precinct of the late Victorian and Federation period in Australia.[3] King Street is often called "Eat Street" in the media due to the large number of cafés, pubs, and restaurants of various cultures.[5] Cafés, restaurants, and galleries can also be found in the streets surrounding King Street.</p>
